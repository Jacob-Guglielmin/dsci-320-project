    "Sub-questions A and B focus on how each dimension of democracy might **correlate** to each other dimension of democracy. The task for sub-question C is similar, in that it also involving **correlation**, examining how each democracy dimension correlates with time. One could also describe these tasks as **characterizing distribution** or variation, if we treat the different dimensions of democracy as attributes within a broader construct and examine the spread of their values within that higher-level concept. Given this framing, determining the delta between largest and smallest value could be considered a **determine range** task. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sub-question D involves **clustering**-- finding groups of countries that are well-balanced, and examining if more countries fit the cluster over time. Lastly, E extends D by examining both 'balanced' and 'imbalanced' **clusters** to see how membership changes over time (i.e. **correlates** with time). \n",
    "\n",
    "A **compute derived value** task might be involved, if one were to compute the standard deviation or other variability measure across the different dimensions of democracy. A **sort** task might also be involved, for example, in sorting countries based on the standard deviation across dimensions of democracy (i.e. democracy indices). Based on this sorted data, we might **find extremum(s)**, i.e. countries with the lowest and highest standard deviation across dimensions of democracy."

    "## Critical Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sketch 1** is a parallel coordinates representation of the different dimensions of democracy,\n",
    "i.e. the high-level indices in the V-Dem dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "One concern with this type of plot\n",
    "is that too many lines make it very difficult to read. Certainly, ~130 lines\n",
    "seems like too many to display simuntaneously. As a result, we intend to experiment\n",
    "with using regional averages, rather than lines for each country. We also intend\n",
    "to experiment with allowing the viewer to **filter** the displayed data, showing only a few\n",
    "countries at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another concern is that the resultant shape can be\n",
    "difficult to interpret-- however, in this case, our main question is simply binary. We ask: Is it close to even, or is it jagged? It is also helpful that we only need to represent five attributes of democracy, so the resultant shape will not be too complex. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these drawbacks, parallel coordinates seem like an appropriate\n",
    "approach, given that it supports straightforward multivariate comparison, i.e. exploring multiple democracy dimensions simultaneously, allowing all high-level democracy indices to be visualized together in a single view.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sketch 2** uses star plots, faceted by country. This type of plot is an appropriate \n",
    "choice for showing relative magnitude across variables with identical ranges. In \n",
    "addition, using a slider for time means that if the viewer wants to make comparisons\n",
    "over time, they have to keep previous values 'in their head' as they slide to a subsequent\n",
    "year. In this way, the representation is best at supporting close temporal comparisons (as \n",
    "one could flip back and forth), but is far from excellent at supporting temporal\n",
    "comparisons which stretch over a longer period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sketch 3** uses color to represent a derived numeric attribute, standard deviation.\n",
    "Using color limits this representation, in that we can only represent a limited \n",
    "number of different levels of this attribute, say ~5. This may be sufficient\n",
    "to differentiate between 'balanced countries' and 'imbalanced' countries! However,\n",
    "it is difficult to know without seeing the plot created. The provided color scale\n",
    "is not optimal-- it might be preferable to use e.g. lightness or a more obvious \n",
    "rainbow scale, to provide a clear indication of which values are greater than others.\n"

    "## Critical Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sketch 4** is a heat map which shows values for each high-level democractic index.\n",
    "Conveniently, each of these indices takes a value between 0 and 1, which makes comparison\n",
    "relatively straightforward. Upon reflection, this representation might actually be better\n",
    "suited for answering analytic question 1, where the task would be to compare colors\n",
    "e.g. along a single row. It might also be suited for answering question 2A, allowing\n",
    "viewers to spot patterns — for example, which countries have similar profiles across\n",
    "dimensions. The color encoding of index value provides an immediate indicator of differences.\n",
    "Though color does not represent numerous values as effectively as e.g. position, this\n",
    "seems fine, given that we do not need exact values, and ~5 values might be sufficient.\n",
    "Including sorting or interactive reordering by region or average score could make it \n",
    "easier to identify clusters and regional distinctiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sketch 5** is also a heat map, but in constrast with sketch 4, it extends over time (-- please note that the lo-fi sketch is missing year values along the x-axis).\n",
    "This representation allows users to view trends over time. Color variation can be compared across years and across countries. One drawback of this representation is that color alone may not convey the direction of change clearly. Additionally, it is difficult to compare across countries seperated by several rows. Options such as collapsing across columns (years) or reordering rows (countries) would better support comparison tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sketch 6** is a line chart, showing values for each high-level index over time (year). The plot is faceted by country. This sketch is effective for showing trends over time for individual democracy indices. With faceting by country, this representation allows viewers to see how the indices move together or diverge within each country, supporting the **correlate** or **characterize distribution** task.\n",
    "\n",
    "One drawback of the design is faceting by country leads to many facets, and the total\n",
    "number of facets may be overwhelming, and is certainly too many to consider simultaneously. An alternative approach might be to facet by region (of which there are 17). Another option would be allowing the viewer to filter by country or region-- with a smaller number of facets, comparison across countries is easier. One critical question might be: is cross-country comparison a priority?\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these drawbacks, this sketch is the strongest representation for this question. It clearly shows how indices move together and change over time within each country. It supports **correlate** and **characterize distribution** tasks. Unlike heat maps, it uses position along a continuous axis, which is well suited for showing numeric data and more effectively illustrates change over time."
