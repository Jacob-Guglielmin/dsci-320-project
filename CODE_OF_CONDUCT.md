# Code of Conduct

We take direct inspiration from the Contributor Covenant, a code of conduct used by many open source organizations.

Our team commits to:
- Engaging kindly and honestly with others.
- Respecting different viewpoints and experiences.
- Taking responsibility for our actions and contributions.
- Gracefully giving and accepting constructive feedback.
- Committing to repairing harm when it occurs.
- Behaving in other ways that promote and sustain the well-being of our group.

This Code of Conduct is adapted in part from the Contributor Covenant 3.0.
