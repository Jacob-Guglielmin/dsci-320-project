# Team Plot Twist - Exploring Democracy

## Dataset 
The dataset is published by the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) Institute, based at the Department of Political Science at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. It is available at https://www.v-dem.net/data/the-v-dem-dataset, and is licensed under CC BY-SA. 

The data describes systems of government by country and year with respect to key democratic principles, and many indicators comprising them, such as qualities of elections, freedom of information, suffrage, civil liberties, health equality, and many others. The attributes are defined at several 'levels' of specificity: 
- 5 high-level indices: the extents to which the ideas of electoral, liberal, participatory, deliberative, and egalitarian democracy are achieved
- 21 mid-level indices: for example, those for freedom of association, free and fair elections, equality under the law, judicial constraints on the executive, elected regional and local government, and equal distribution of rights, resources, and power
- 365 low-level indicators: for example, those for judicial purges, thresholds for binding plebiscites, gender balance in journalism, election losers accepting results, etc.
